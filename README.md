# h3acnvcalls-web-service

The h3acnvcalls-web-service queries a database that stores structural variants in human genomes. The database has data about the location of the variant(chromosome number, start and end), type of variant and number of times the variant was found in the data set.

This web-service was created to allow for simple querying of the results obtained from the structural variant analyses.

The application uses Flask, sqlite3 and Jinja2.
